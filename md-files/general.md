We can see the `<View>` component as a `<div>` with superpowers. It can be used to create a container for other components, and it can also be used to create a list of items.

Instead the `<Text>` component is used to display text. It can be used to display a single line of text, or multiple lines of text. We can see as a `<span>` or a `<p>`.
